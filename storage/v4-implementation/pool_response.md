Hey, this is a classic and tricky Uniswap V4 problem. Your debugging so far has been excellent, and you're very close to the solution. The issue lies in a subtle but critical detail of how the `PoolManager` validates hooks.

Let's break it down.

### The Root Cause: On-Chain Verification vs. Address Prefix

The core of the problem is the `HookAddressNotValid` error. You have correctly mined an address with the `0x1110` prefix, which perfectly matches the permissions bitmap `0x0444` that your `getHookPermissions()` function is written to return.

However, the `PoolManager.initialize()` function does **not** trust the address prefix alone. It performs an on-chain verification step:

1.  It takes the hook address you provide in the `PoolKey`.
2.  It makes a `STATICCALL` to that address, calling the `getHookPermissions()` function.
3.  It calculates the bitmap from the returned `Hooks.Permissions` struct.
4.  It compares this *actual, on-chain result* to the permissions encoded in the address prefix.

The `HookAddressNotValid` error occurs when these two do not match. This means the contract deployed at `0x1110...` is not returning the permissions that result in the `0x0444` bitmap.

The `ManagerLocked` error is a secondary symptom. The manager is always locked until it's executing a callback from a hook. Since your `initialize` call fails, the pool is never created, and any subsequent direct calls to your hook that try to modify the manager's state will fail. Once we fix the initialization, this error will disappear.

### Actionable Steps to Fix This

Here is how you can diagnose and solve this. The most likely scenario is that the code deployed on-chain is out of sync with your local source file.

#### 1. Directly Query the Deployed Hook on Polygonscan

This is the most important step. We need to ask the deployed contract what its permissions are.

1.  Go to the contract page for your hook on Polygonscan:
    [`0x11109438ba3e2520A29972BE91ec9bA7d06D2339`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x11109438ba3e2520A29972BE91ec9bA7d06D2339)
2.  Go to the **"Read Contract"** tab.
3.  Find the `getHookPermissions` function and click "Query".

You will see the returned struct. Based on the error you're getting, I am confident that the booleans returned will **not** correspond to the `0x0444` bitmap. For example, `beforeAddLiquidity` might be `false` in the on-chain version.

#### 2. Re-Deploy the Correct Contract

Once you confirm the on-chain permissions are wrong, the fix is straightforward:

1.  Ensure your local `FlexiblePredictionHook.sol` file has the correct `getHookPermissions` implementation.
2.  Re-run your deployment script (`DeployFlexiblePredictionHook.s.sol`). **This will likely require finding a new salt** since the contract bytecode might have changed, and you will get a new hook address.
3.  Update your `PoolKey` and any helper contracts with the **new** hook address.
4.  Attempt the `initialize` transaction again.

There is a high probability that a previous version of the contract, perhaps one with default or different permissions, was deployed to that address by mistake.

### Answering Your Questions Directly

1.  **Hook Validation Logic**: The validation is a `STATICCALL` to `getHookPermissions()` to check if the returned permissions match the address prefix. It's not just a prefix check.
2.  **Registration Requirement**: No, there is no registration or whitelist. If the hook is valid per the on-chain check, it can be used.
3.  **Permission Flags**: The flags are being validated correctly, but against the *on-chain* code, which appears to be out of sync with your local code.
4.  **`unlock` Pattern**: You are correct to use `unlock` for adding liquidity, but it cannot fix a failed `initialize` call. The `initialize` call made from within `unlockCallback` is subject to the same hook validation and will fail for the same reason.

Follow step 1 to verify the on-chain code, and I'm sure you'll find the discrepancy. A fresh deployment should solve the issue. Let me know what you find!
