# ‚úÖ READY TO TEST - MATIC Transfer

## What's Ready

### üåê RPC Configuration
- **Automatic**: Public RPCs are pre-configured in `config/public_rpcs.json`
- **No setup needed**: Works immediately with public endpoints
- **Fallback system**: Tries multiple RPCs until one works

### üîë Account Configuration
- **Account 1**: Uses `PRIVATE_KEY1` from `.env`
- **Account 2**: Uses `PRIVATE_KEY2` from `.env`
- Both accounts ready to use

## Quick Test Commands

### 1. Test RPC Connections
```bash
python test_rpcs.py
```
This will test connections to Polygon, Sepolia, and Mumbai networks.

### 2. Check Your Account Addresses & Balances
```bash
python test_accounts.py
```
This shows both account addresses and their balances.

### 3. Send 0.01 MATIC Between Accounts
```bash
# Automated test (sends from Account 1 to Account 2)
python test_transfer.py

# Or manual with more control
python scripts/interact/send_native.py --network polygon --from-account 1 --amount 0.01
```

## What You Need

‚úÖ **Already Done:**
- Private keys configured (`PRIVATE_KEY1` and `PRIVATE_KEY2`)
- RPC connections ready (using public RPCs)
- Scripts and safety checks implemented

‚ùå **Still Needed:**
