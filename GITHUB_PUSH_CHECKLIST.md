- [ ] hook_salt.txt (contains deployment salt)
- [ ] Any file with *_private* in name
- [ ] Browser history or cache files
- [ ] Local blockchain data

### üìã Pre-Push Commands

```bash
# 1. Verify no sensitive files are staged
git status

# 2. Check for private keys in staged files
git diff --staged | grep -i "private\|secret\|key\|mnemonic\|seed"

# 3. Verify .env is not tracked
git ls-files | grep -E "\.env$"

# 4. Remove sensitive files if found
git rm --cached .env
git rm --cached hook_salt.txt

# 5. Add security warning to README
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è This is experimental code with known security issues. Do not use in production." >> README.md
```

### üöÄ Push Instructions (AFTER ALL CHECKS)

```bash
# 1. Stage safe files only
git add README.md STATUS.md SECURITY_AUDIT.md
git add src/*.sol
git add script/*.sol
git add gui/src/
git add .gitignore .env.example
git add poolvalidation.md pool_response.md

# 2. Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: Add FlexiblePredictionHook - constant-sum AMM for prediction markets

SECURITY WARNING: Known issues documented in SECURITY_AUDIT.md
- Reentrancy vulnerability in removeLiquidity
- Missing slippage protection
- Requires security fixes before production use

Current Status: Blocked on Uniswap V4 pool initialization (see STATUS.md)"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Post-Push Actions

1. **Immediately check GitHub** to verify no sensitive data was pushed
2. **If private key was accidentally pushed**:
   - Immediately transfer all funds from that wallet
   - Delete the repository or force push cleaned history
   - Rotate all exposed credentials
3. **Add repository description**: "Experimental Uniswap V4 prediction market - NOT PRODUCTION READY"
4. **Add topics**: `uniswap-v4`, `prediction-market`, `polygon`, `experimental`, `security-audit-needed`
5. **Consider making repo private** until security issues are resolved
