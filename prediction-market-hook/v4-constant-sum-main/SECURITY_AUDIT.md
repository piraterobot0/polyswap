# Security Audit Results - FlexiblePredictionHook

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

The blockchain security audit has identified several critical vulnerabilities in the deployed FlexiblePredictionHook contract at `0x4a8AE4911c363f2669215fb5b330132EA41a532c`.

## Status: DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

### Critical Issues Found:

1. **Missing Reentrancy Protection** - The contract lacks guards against reentrancy attacks
2. **Incorrect Token Transfer Pattern** - Tokens transferred to wrong address creating accounting issues  
3. **No Access Control** - Anyone can manipulate liquidity and ratios
4. **Integer Overflow Risks** - Unchecked arithmetic in swap logic
5. **Front-Running Vulnerability** - No slippage protection

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **DO NOT ADD SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY** to the deployed contract
2. **DO NOT USE FOR REAL TRADING** until issues are fixed
3. Consider this a **TESTNET/DEMO DEPLOYMENT ONLY**

### Next Steps:

1. Create SecureFlexibleHook.sol with all security fixes
2. Add reentrancy guards using OpenZeppelin
3. Implement proper access control
4. Add slippage protection parameters
5. Get professional audit before mainnet use

## For Development/Testing Only

The current deployment can be used for:
- Testing SDK integration
- Demo purposes with minimal amounts
- Learning about Uniswap V4 hooks

But should **NOT** be used for:
- Production trading
- Significant liquidity
- Real prediction markets

## Recommended Safe Implementation

See `src/SecureFlexibleHook.sol` (to be created) for a production-ready version with:
- ReentrancyGuard
- Access control
- Proper token handling
- Slippage protection
- Emergency pause functionality
