# Liquidity Status Report

## Current Situation

The prediction market hook is deployed but **cannot accept liquidity** due to implementation issues.

### Deployment Details
- **Hook Address**: `0x349810b251D655169fAd188CAC0F70c534130327`
- **Deployer Wallet**: `0x884F5C47fA1eCaF0C8957611f648Fb320551ab51`
- **Network**: Polygon Mainnet

### Available Resources
✅ **Wallet has**:
- 1.81 MATIC (sufficient for gas)
- 3000000 wei YES tokens (0.000000000003)
- 2000001 wei NO tokens (0.000000000002000001)
- Private key is available in `.env`

### Technical Issues

1. **Pool Initialization Fails**
   - Transaction: `0x97c84535bd68cdf149cfa47b13eb16a225d5b04c6a96ebd436e0762dc946323b`
   - The pool manager cannot initialize the pool with this hook

2. **Add Liquidity Fails**
   - Transaction: `0x82b699922adb22f9cab34ba1773d137a955ecd786f2911941abc04c6368286d5`
   - The `addInitialLiquidity` function reverts

### Root Cause Analysis

The hook implementation has several issues:

1. **Token Transfer Logic**: The function tries to transfer 80% of YES and 20% of NO from the total amount, but we only have tiny amounts of each token.

2. **Token Ordering**: The function assumes currency0 is YES and currency1 is NO, but in our case:
   - currency0 = `0x91BdE82669D279B37a5F4Fe44c0D4b06054577B1` (YES)
   - currency1 = `0xcDb79f7f9D387cd034e87abAc34e222F146fc3C5` (NO)

3. **Amount Mismatch**: With only 3000000 wei YES and 2000001 wei NO, the function would try to transfer:
   - 80% of 5000001 = 4000000 wei YES (but we only have 3000000)
   - 20% of 5000001 = 1000000 wei NO (we have enough)

### Solutions Attempted

1. ✅ Found deployment wallet with private key
2. ✅ Confirmed wallet has MATIC and tokens
3. ✅ Created multiple scripts to add liquidity
4. ❌ Pool initialization fails
5. ❌ Direct liquidity addition fails

## Next Steps

To make this work, you would need to:

### Option 1: Redeploy with Fixed Implementation
Deploy a new version of the hook that:
- Accepts the actual token amounts available
- Properly handles token ordering
- Has a more flexible liquidity initialization

### Option 2: Get More Tokens
- Acquire at least 4000000 wei YES tokens (currently have 3000000)
- Then retry the liquidity addition

### Option 3: Deploy on Testnet First
- Deploy and test on Mumbai testnet
- Iron out issues before mainnet deployment

## Scripts Created

All scripts are ready in `/scripts`:
- `add-liquidity.js` - Full liquidity addition
- `add-minimal-liquidity.js` - Attempts with tiny amounts
- `initialize-pool.js` - Pool initialization
- `continue-liquidity.js` - Continue from approval
- `check-deployer-wallet.js` - Check wallet status
- `pool-reader.js` - Read pool state

## Conclusion

The hook is deployed but **not functional** for liquidity due to implementation constraints. The contract expects specific token amounts that don't match what's available. A redeployment with a more flexible implementation or acquiring the exact token amounts needed would be required to proceed.
